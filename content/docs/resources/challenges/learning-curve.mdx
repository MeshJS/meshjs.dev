  faqs={[
    {
      question: "How hard is it to learn Cardano development?",
      answer: "Cardano has a steeper learning curve than most blockchains due to its UTXO model, native asset system, and functional programming foundations. However, tools like Mesh SDK significantly reduce the barrier by providing familiar JavaScript/TypeScript APIs that abstract the underlying complexity while still giving you access when needed."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to learn Haskell to build on Cardano?",
      answer: "No. While Plutus smart contracts are written in Haskell, you can build full dApps using JavaScript/TypeScript with Mesh SDK. For on-chain logic, alternative languages like Aiken, Helios, and OpShin offer more familiar syntax. Most Cardano development happens off-chain where JavaScript works perfectly."
    },
    {
      question: "What makes Cardano different from Ethereum for developers?",
      answer: "The main difference is Cardano's UTXO model versus Ethereum's account model. Instead of updating balances, you spend and create discrete outputs. Transactions are deterministic—you know exactly what will happen before submitting. Native assets don't require smart contracts. These differences require new mental models but provide benefits like parallel transaction processing."
    },
    {
      question: "What should I learn first when starting Cardano development?",
      answer: "Start with wallet integration and simple transactions using Mesh SDK. This teaches the UTXO model practically without overwhelming theory. Then explore native assets, then metadata, and finally smart contracts. Each step builds on previous knowledge. Mesh's API design guides this progression naturally."
    },
    {
      question: "Why does Cardano use so many unfamiliar terms?",
      answer: "Cardano draws from academic research and functional programming, leading to precise but unfamiliar terminology. 'Lovelace' instead of 'smallest ADA unit,' 'datum' instead of 'data,' 'redeemer' instead of 'input.' Mesh SDK uses clearer naming while maintaining compatibility, helping bridge the terminology gap."
    }

Cardano's learning curve stems from its unique UTXO model, native asset system, Haskell-based smart contracts, and academic terminology that differs from other blockchains. Mesh SDK dramatically flattens this curve by providing intuitive JavaScript and TypeScript APIs that let you build functional dApps immediately while gradually introducing underlying concepts. You can ship your first transaction in minutes, then deepen your understanding over time.

## Why This Happens

Cardano was designed with formal verification, security, and scalability as primary goals. These priorities led to architectural decisions that benefit users and the network but create a steeper initial learning curve for developers coming from other ecosystems.

### The UTXO Mental Model Shift

Most developers encounter account-based blockchains first. Ethereum's model feels intuitive—accounts have balances, and transactions modify those balances. Cardano's UTXO model works fundamentally differently:

- You don't have a "balance"—you have a set of discrete, unspent outputs
- Transactions consume existing outputs entirely and create new ones
- You can't partially spend a UTXO; you must create change
- Multiple transactions can't modify the same output, enabling parallelism

This isn't harder, just different. Once understood, the UTXO model offers significant advantages. But initial confusion is common.

### Haskell and Academic Foundations

Cardano's research-first approach means:

- Smart contracts use Plutus, built on Haskell—a functional language unfamiliar to most developers
- Documentation assumes familiarity with concepts like monads, lambda calculus, and type theory
- Terminology prioritizes precision over accessibility (datums, redeemers, plutus data)

### Native Assets Without Smart Contracts

On Cardano, tokens and NFTs are native—they don't require smart contracts to exist. This is powerful but unfamiliar:

- Tokens are defined by minting policies, not contract addresses
- Assets are identified by policy IDs and asset names, not contract calls
- Tokens live in UTXOs alongside ADA, creating the "minimum ADA" requirement

### Fragmented Documentation

Because Cardano development spans multiple languages and tools, documentation is scattered:

- Cardano Foundation materials for concepts
- IOG documentation for Plutus
- Community-built tool documentation
- Multiple competing approaches for similar tasks

This fragmentation makes it hard to find clear, current answers.

## How Mesh Solves This

Mesh SDK was built specifically to make Cardano development accessible. It provides progressive complexity—simple APIs for common tasks, full control when you need it.

### Familiar JavaScript/TypeScript APIs

Mesh uses patterns familiar to web developers:

```typescript
import { MeshWallet, BlockfrostProvider } from "@meshsdk/core";

// Initialize provider - similar to ethers.js pattern
const provider = new BlockfrostProvider("<your-api-key>");

// Create or restore a wallet
const wallet = new MeshWallet({
  networkId: 0, // testnet
  fetcher: provider,
  submitter: provider,
  key: {
    type: "mnemonic",
    words: ["your", "mnemonic", "phrase", "..."],
  },
});

// Get address - just like other blockchain SDKs
const address = wallet.getChangeAddress();
```

### React Components for Rapid Development

For frontend developers, Mesh provides ready-to-use React components:

```tsx
import { CardanoWallet, useWallet } from "@meshsdk/react";

function App() {
  const { connected, wallet } = useWallet();

  return (
    <div>
      <CardanoWallet />
      {connected && <p>Connected! Address: {wallet.getChangeAddress()}</p>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

No need to understand CIP-30 wallet standards—Mesh handles it all.

### Clear Transaction Building

MeshTxBuilder uses a fluent interface that reads naturally:

```typescript
import { MeshTxBuilder } from "@meshsdk/core";

const txBuilder = new MeshTxBuilder({
  fetcher: provider,
  submitter: provider,
});

const unsignedTx = await txBuilder
  .txOut(recipientAddress, [{ unit: "lovelace", quantity: "5000000" }])
  .changeAddress(myAddress)
  .selectUtxosFrom(myUtxos)
  .complete();
```

The API describes intent ("send 5 ADA to this address") rather than forcing you to manage UTXOs manually.

## Quick Start

Get your first Cardano transaction working in three steps:

**Step 1: Install Mesh SDK**

```bash
npm install @meshsdk/core @meshsdk/react
```

Mesh is TypeScript-first with full type definitions, providing excellent IDE support and catching errors early.

**Step 2: Connect a wallet**

```typescript
import { BrowserWallet } from "@meshsdk/core";

// Connect to any CIP-30 compatible wallet
const wallet = await BrowserWallet.enable("eternl");

// Or let users choose from installed wallets
const availableWallets = await BrowserWallet.getAvailableWallets();
```

**Step 3: Build and submit a transaction**

```typescript
import { MeshTxBuilder, BlockfrostProvider } from "@meshsdk/core";

const provider = new BlockfrostProvider("<your-blockfrost-key>");

const txBuilder = new MeshTxBuilder({
  fetcher: provider,
  submitter: provider,
});

const unsignedTx = await txBuilder
  .txOut("addr_test1...", [{ unit: "lovelace", quantity: "2000000" }])
  .changeAddress(await wallet.getChangeAddress())
  .selectUtxosFrom(await wallet.getUtxos())
  .complete();

const signedTx = await wallet.signTx(unsignedTx);
const txHash = await wallet.submitTx(signedTx);

console.log(`Transaction submitted: ${txHash}`);
```

You've just built and submitted a Cardano transaction without manually managing UTXOs, calculating fees, or understanding serialization formats.

## Progressive Learning Path

Mesh's design supports learning Cardano concepts gradually:

### Week 1: Wallets and Basic Transactions

Start with wallet connections and ADA transfers. This teaches:
- How addresses work on Cardano
- The basic transaction lifecycle (build → sign → submit)
- Reading wallet balances and UTXOs

### Week 2: Native Assets

Add token and NFT operations:

```typescript
// Query tokens in a wallet
const assets = await wallet.getAssets();

// Send tokens
const tx = await txBuilder
  .txOut(recipient, [
    { unit: "lovelace", quantity: "2000000" },
    { unit: policyId + assetName, quantity: "10" }
  ])
  .changeAddress(changeAddress)
  .selectUtxosFrom(utxos)
  .complete();
```

This teaches native asset mechanics and minimum UTXO requirements.

### Week 3: Metadata and Advanced Transactions

Add transaction metadata:

```typescript
const tx = await txBuilder
  .txOut(recipient, [{ unit: "lovelace", quantity: "5000000" }])
  .metadataValue(674, { message: "Hello, Cardano!" })
  .changeAddress(changeAddress)
  .selectUtxosFrom(utxos)
  .complete();
```

### Week 4+: Smart Contracts

When ready for smart contracts, Mesh supports Plutus interaction:

```typescript
const tx = await txBuilder
  .spendingPlutusScript("V2")
  .txIn(scriptUtxo.input.txHash, scriptUtxo.input.outputIndex)
  .txInScript(scriptCbor)
  .txInDatumValue(datum)
  .txInRedeemerValue(redeemer)
  // ... rest of transaction
  .complete();
```

By this point, terms like "datum" and "redeemer" make sense from practical context.

## Bridging the Terminology Gap

Mesh uses clear naming while maintaining Cardano compatibility:

| Cardano Term | What It Means | Mesh Usage |
|--------------|---------------|------------|
| Lovelace | Smallest ADA unit (1 ADA = 1,000,000 lovelace) | `{ unit: "lovelace", quantity: "1000000" }` |
| UTXO | Unspent transaction output—a "coin" you can spend | `wallet.getUtxos()` returns these |
| Datum | Data attached to a script output | `txInDatumValue()` sets this |
| Redeemer | Input to unlock a script output | `txInRedeemerValue()` sets this |
| Policy ID | Unique identifier for a token collection | Part of the asset unit string |
