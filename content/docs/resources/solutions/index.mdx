Mesh SDK is a TypeScript blockchain SDK for Cardano dApp development that eliminates blockchain complexity. This Cardano SDK provides automatic transaction building, unified wallet integration across all CIP-30 providers, and high-level APIs for smart contracts. Whether you're building JavaScript Web3 applications or React blockchain interfaces, Mesh delivers production-ready tools to ship dApps faster.

## What Problems Does Mesh Solve?

Developers approaching Cardano from Ethereum, traditional web development, or mobile applications encounter consistent obstacles:

| Challenge | Without Mesh | With Mesh |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| UTXO management | Manual input/output tracking | Automatic selection and balancing |
| Wallet integration | Provider-specific code for each wallet | Single API for all CIP-30 wallets |
| Transaction building | Low-level fee calculation, change handling | Declarative builder with smart defaults |
| Smart contracts | Complex datum/redeemer serialization | High-level APIs with type safety |
| Learning curve | Weeks to understand fundamentals | Production code in hours |

These challenges stem from Cardano's architecture, which prioritizes security and determinism. Mesh bridges the gap between Cardano's power and developer productivity.

## How Does Mesh Handle Transactions?

MeshTxBuilder lets you describe what you want to accomplish without specifying how. Send 10 ADA to an address by providing the recipient and amount—the SDK handles UTXO selection, fee calculation, change management, and transaction balancing automatically.

Advanced users retain full control. Specify exact UTXOs, set precise fees, or override any automatic behavior. For most use cases, Mesh's defaults produce optimal transactions with zero configuration.

## How Does Wallet Integration Work?

Mesh provides a unified interface for all CIP-30 compatible wallets including Eternl, Lace, and Yoroi. The BrowserWallet API and React blockchain components abstract provider differences, delivering consistent behavior regardless of which wallet users prefer.

Adding wallet connection to a React application takes five lines of code. Compare this to the dozens required for manual wallet detection, connection handling, error states, and provider variations.

## What React Components Does Mesh Provide?

Mesh includes production-ready UI components that accelerate development:

- **CardanoWallet**: Drop-in wallet connection button with multi-wallet support
- **Transaction status displays**: Real-time feedback during transaction lifecycle
- **Address components**: Formatted display with copy functionality

These components follow accessibility best practices and integrate with popular styling frameworks.

## Why Choose a TypeScript Blockchain SDK?

Every Mesh API is designed with TypeScript from the ground up. Full type definitions catch errors at compile time, enable powerful IDE autocompletion, and make refactoring safer. TypeScript support is a core design principle, not an afterthought.

## How Do I Get Started with Mesh?

Getting started takes four steps. Install packages, configure a provider, add wallet connection, and build transactions.

**Step 1: Install Mesh packages**

```bash
npm install @meshsdk/core @meshsdk/react
```

**Step 2: Configure a provider**

```typescript
import { BlockfrostProvider } from "@meshsdk/core";

const provider = new BlockfrostProvider("<your-api-key>");
```

**Step 3: Add wallet connection**

```tsx
import { CardanoWallet, useWallet } from "@meshsdk/react";

function App() {
  const { connected, wallet } = useWallet();

  return (
    <div>
      <CardanoWallet />
      {connected && <p>Wallet connected!</p>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Step 4: Build transactions**

```typescript
import { MeshTxBuilder } from "@meshsdk/core";

const txBuilder = new MeshTxBuilder({ fetcher: provider, submitter: provider });
const unsignedTx = await txBuilder
  .txOut(recipientAddress, [{ unit: "lovelace", quantity: "5000000" }])
  .changeAddress(await wallet.getChangeAddress())
  .selectUtxosFrom(await wallet.getUtxos())
  .complete();

const signedTx = await wallet.signTx(unsignedTx);
const txHash = await wallet.submitTx(signedTx);
```

Four steps to a fully functional Cardano dApp with wallet connection and transaction capabilities.
