      question: "What is the fastest way to integrate Cardano wallets?",
      answer: "Mesh SDK provides the fastest Cardano wallet integration. Install @meshsdk/react, wrap your app with MeshProvider, and add the CardanoWallet component. This gives you multi-wallet support in under 5 minutes with no wallet-specific code required."
    },
    {
      question: "Does Mesh support all Cardano wallets?",
      answer: "Yes, Mesh supports all CIP-30 compatible wallets including Eternl, Lace, Yoroi, Typhon, and more. The unified API works identically across all wallets, eliminating the need for wallet-specific implementations."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I detect installed Cardano wallets?",
      answer: "Use BrowserWallet.getInstalledWallets() to get a list of all installed CIP-30 wallets. This returns wallet metadata including name, icon, and identifier for building custom wallet selection UIs."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I customize the Mesh wallet connection UI?",
      answer: "Absolutely. While CardanoWallet provides a ready-to-use component, you can build fully custom UIs using the BrowserWallet class and useWallet hook. Mesh provides all the building blocks for any design requirement."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I handle wallet connection state in React?",
      answer: "The useWallet hook provides reactive state including connected status, wallet instance, and connect/disconnect functions. State updates automatically when users connect or disconnect, triggering re-renders in your components."

Mesh SDK offers the fastest path to Cardano wallet integration, reducing days of development to minutes. With a unified API that works across all CIP-30 compatible wallets and pre-built React components, you can add professional wallet connectivity to your dApp without writing wallet-specific code or handling provider variations manually.

## Quick Start

Get wallet connectivity working in your Cardano dApp with four simple steps:

**Step 1: Install Mesh packages**

```bash
npm install @meshsdk/core @meshsdk/react
```

**Step 2: Add MeshProvider**

```tsx
import { MeshProvider } from "@meshsdk/react";

function App() {
  return (
    <MeshProvider>
      <YourApp />
    </MeshProvider>
  );
}
```

**Step 3: Add the wallet component**

```tsx
import { CardanoWallet } from "@meshsdk/react";

function Header() {
  return (
    <header>
      <Logo />
      <CardanoWallet />
    </header>
  );
}
```

**Step 4: Access wallet state**

```tsx
import { useWallet } from "@meshsdk/react";

function Dashboard() {
  const { connected, wallet } = useWallet();

  if (!connected) return <p>Please connect your wallet</p>;

  return <WalletDashboard wallet={wallet} />;
}
```

That's it. Your dApp now supports all major Cardano wallets.

## Features

Mesh wallet integration provides comprehensive functionality out of the box:

- **Universal Wallet Support**: Works with Eternl, Lace, Yoroi, Typhon, and all CIP-30 compatible wallets
- **Pre-built Components**: CardanoWallet component provides wallet selection, connection, and address display
- **React Hooks**: useWallet hook offers reactive state management for wallet connection
- **Automatic Detection**: Identifies all installed wallets without manual configuration
- **Normalized API**: Consistent method signatures regardless of underlying wallet
- **TypeScript Support**: Full type definitions for IDE autocompletion and compile-time safety
- **Error Normalization**: Consistent error types across different wallet implementations
- **Connection State**: Reactive state updates when wallet connects or disconnects

## Key Capabilities

### Wallet Detection

Automatically discover installed wallets without hardcoding wallet identifiers:

```typescript
import { BrowserWallet } from "@meshsdk/core";

const wallets = BrowserWallet.getInstalledWallets();
// Returns: [{ id: 'eternl', name: 'Eternl', icon: '...', ... }, ...]
```

### Unified Connection API

Connect to any wallet with the same code:

```typescript
// Connect to specific wallet
const wallet = await BrowserWallet.enable("eternl");

// All methods work identically regardless of wallet
const address = await wallet.getChangeAddress();
const utxos = await wallet.getUtxos();
const balance = await wallet.getBalance();
const networkId = await wallet.getNetworkId();
```

### React State Management

The useWallet hook provides everything needed for wallet UI:

```tsx
const {
  connected,      // boolean - connection status
  wallet,         // wallet instance with methods
  connect,        // function to initiate connection
  disconnect,     // function to disconnect
  connecting,     // boolean - connection in progress
  name,           // connected wallet name
} = useWallet();
```

### Custom Wallet UI

Build branded wallet selectors using Mesh primitives:

```tsx
function CustomWalletButton() {
  const { connect, connected, disconnect, name } = useWallet();
  const wallets = BrowserWallet.getInstalledWallets();

  if (connected) {
    return (
      <button onClick={disconnect}>
        Disconnect {name}
      </button>
    );
  }

  return (
    <div className="wallet-options">
      {wallets.map(w => (
        <button key={w.id} onClick={() => connect(w.id)}>
          <img src={w.icon} alt={w.name} />
          {w.name}
        </button>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Why Mesh for Wallet Integration

### Eliminates Complexity

Without Mesh, you'd write separate handling for each wallet, manage detection logic, normalize API differences, and handle error variations. Mesh encapsulates all this complexity in a clean, consistent interface.

### Production Tested

Mesh powers wallet integration for some of the largest Cardano dApps. The wallet handling code has been battle-tested across millions of transactions and thousands of users.

### Actively Maintained

When new wallets launch or existing wallets update, Mesh stays current. You don't need to track wallet ecosystem changes—Mesh handles compatibility for you.

### Developer Experience

TypeScript types, comprehensive documentation, and intuitive APIs mean less time reading wallet specs and more time building features.

## Common Integration Patterns

### Connection Persistence

Remember user's wallet choice across sessions:

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  const savedWallet = localStorage.getItem("preferredWallet");
  if (savedWallet && !connected) {
    connect(savedWallet);
  }
}, []);

useEffect(() => {
  if (connected && wallet) {
    localStorage.setItem("preferredWallet", wallet.walletId);
  }
}, [connected]);
```

### Network Validation

Ensure users are on the correct network:

```tsx
const networkId = await wallet.getNetworkId();
if (networkId !== 1) { // 1 = mainnet, 0 = testnet
  throw new Error("Please switch to Mainnet");
}
```

### Graceful Error Handling

Handle common wallet errors:

```tsx
try {
  await connect(walletId);
} catch (error) {
  if (error.message.includes("User")) {
    showToast("Connection cancelled");
  } else if (error.message.includes("popup")) {
    showToast("Please allow popups for wallet connection");
  } else {
    showToast("Failed to connect wallet");
  }
}
```
