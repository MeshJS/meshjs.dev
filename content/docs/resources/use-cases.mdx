Discover how developers and organizations are using Mesh to build innovative Cardano applications. From DeFi platforms to NFT marketplaces, Mesh powers a wide range of blockchain solutions.

## DeFi Applications

### Decentralized Exchanges (DEX)

Mesh provides the perfect foundation for building decentralized exchanges on Cardano:

- **Automated Market Makers (AMM)**: Build liquidity pools and swap mechanisms with Mesh's transaction builder
- **Order Book DEXs**: Manage complex order matching with smart contract integration
- **Multi-Asset Swaps**: Handle native token exchanges with ease

**Key Features Used:**
- Transaction building APIs
- Multi-asset handling
- Smart contract integration
- Wallet connections

### Lending Protocols

Create secure lending and borrowing platforms:

- **Collateral Management**: Lock and release assets with smart contracts
- **Interest Calculations**: Automated interest accrual and distribution
- **Liquidation Mechanisms**: Monitor and execute collateral liquidations

**Real-World Example:**
Lending protocols use Mesh to handle complex multi-party transactions, ensuring secure collateral locks and automated interest payments through Plutus smart contracts.

### Staking Platforms

Build custom staking solutions:

- **Stake Pool Delegation**: Simplified delegation interfaces
- **Rewards Distribution**: Automated reward calculations and distributions
- **Multi-Pool Support**: Manage delegations across multiple pools

## NFT Marketplaces

### NFT Minting Platforms

Mesh simplifies NFT creation and distribution:

- **Single NFT Minting**: Easy one-off NFT creation
- **Collection Launches**: Batch minting for entire collections
- **Generative Art**: Create unique combinations programmatically
- **Metadata Management**: CIP-25 and CIP-68 compliance

**Implementation tip:** For minting NFTs in your own project, use the modern `MeshTxBuilder` APIs shown in the [Mint and Burn Assets guide](/apis/txbuilder/minting) rather than the legacy `Transaction` class.

### Secondary Marketplaces

Power NFT trading platforms with Mesh:

- **Listing Management**: List and delist NFTs for sale
- **Bidding Systems**: Implement auction mechanisms
- **Instant Purchases**: Enable direct NFT purchases
- **Royalty Enforcement**: Automated creator royalty distributions

**Key Features:**
- Smart contract escrow
- Multi-signature support
- Metadata resolution
- Price oracles integration

## Wallet Applications

### Browser Extension Wallets

Build feature-rich Cardano wallets:

- **Key Management**: Secure mnemonic and key storage
- **Transaction Signing**: Sign and submit transactions
- **dApp Connector**: CIP-30 compliance for dApp integration
- **Multi-Account Support**: Manage multiple addresses

### Hardware Wallet Integration

Integrate with hardware wallets for enhanced security:

- **Ledger Support**: Connect with Ledger devices
- **Trezor Integration**: Support for Trezor hardware wallets
- **Air-Gapped Signing**: Build offline transaction signing flows

## Gaming & Metaverse

### Blockchain Games

Create engaging gaming experiences on Cardano:

- **In-Game Assets**: Represent items as NFTs
- **Play-to-Earn**: Token rewards and economies
- **Character NFTs**: Unique, tradeable characters
- **Land Ownership**: Virtual real estate on-chain

**Use Case Example:**
A trading card game uses Mesh to handle card minting, trading between players, and tournament rewards distribution, all with seamless wallet integration.

### Virtual Worlds

Build metaverse platforms:

- **Land Parcels**: NFT-based land ownership
- **Avatar Systems**: Customizable NFT avatars
- **Virtual Economies**: In-world token systems
- **Social Features**: Decentralized identity and messaging
