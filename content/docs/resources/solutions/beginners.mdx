  faqs={[
    {
      question: "Can I build Cardano dApps without blockchain experience?",
      answer: "Yes. Mesh SDK is designed for JavaScript developers without blockchain backgrounds. The APIs use familiar patterns like classes, async/await, and React hooks. You don't need to understand UTxO internals or Cardano protocols to build functional dApps."
    },
    {
      question: "What programming knowledge do I need for Cardano development?",
      answer: "Basic JavaScript or TypeScript knowledge is sufficient to start with Mesh SDK. If you can build a React application or use npm packages, you have enough skills to build Cardano dApps with Mesh."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to learn Cardano development with Mesh?",
      answer: "Most developers can build their first working Cardano transaction within an hour using Mesh SDK. The wallet connection takes minutes, and the transaction builder uses intuitive method chaining. Deeper features like smart contracts take longer but follow the same accessible patterns."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the easiest way to start building on Cardano?",
      answer: "Install Mesh SDK, add the CardanoWallet component for wallet connection, then use MeshTxBuilder to send ADA. Mesh handles serialization, fee calculation, and UTxO management automatically, so you focus on what your dApp does rather than how Cardano works."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to understand UTxO to use Mesh SDK?",
      answer: "No. While Cardano uses a UTxO model different from Ethereum's account model, Mesh abstracts this complexity. The SDK handles UTxO selection, change outputs, and transaction balancing automatically. You simply specify what you want to send and where."
    }
  ]}
/>

Mesh SDK opens Cardano development to every JavaScript developer. Instead of studying cryptographic primitives, learning UTxO mechanics, and writing low-level serialization code, you use intuitive APIs that feel like standard web development. Send ADA with a few lines of code, connect wallets with a single component, and build transactions with readable method chains.

## Quick Start

Build your first Cardano dApp in minutes:

**Step 1: Install Mesh**

```bash
npm install @meshsdk/core @meshsdk/react
```

**Step 2: Add wallet connection**

```tsx
import { MeshProvider } from "@meshsdk/react";
import { CardanoWallet } from "@meshsdk/react";

function App() {
  return (
    <MeshProvider>
      <CardanoWallet />
    </MeshProvider>
  );
}
```

**Step 3: Send your first transaction**

```tsx
import { useWallet } from "@meshsdk/react";
import { MeshTxBuilder } from "@meshsdk/core";

function SendADA() {
  const { wallet, connected } = useWallet();

  const sendADA = async () => {
    const utxos = await wallet.getUtxos();
    const changeAddress = await wallet.getChangeAddress();

    const txBuilder = new MeshTxBuilder();

    const unsignedTx = await txBuilder
      .txOut("addr_test1...", [{ unit: "lovelace", quantity: "5000000" }])
      .changeAddress(changeAddress)
      .selectUtxosFrom(utxos)
      .complete();

    const signedTx = await wallet.signTx(unsignedTx);
    const txHash = await wallet.submitTx(signedTx);

    console.log("Transaction submitted:", txHash);
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={sendADA} disabled={!connected}>
      Send 5 ADA
    </button>
  );
}
```

That's a complete Cardano transaction in about 10 lines of code.

- **Progressive Learning**: Start simple and add advanced features as you grow
- **Full Documentation**: Guides, examples, and API references for every skill level
- **Active Community**: Discord support and examples from other developers
- **Testnet Support**: Practice with free test ADA before using real funds

## Concepts Made Simple

### Wallets Just Work

Cardano has many wallets (Eternl, Lace, Yoroi, etc.). Normally you'd write different code for each. Mesh provides one interface that works with all of them:

```tsx
import { CardanoWallet, useWallet } from "@meshsdk/react";

// Drop-in component handles everything
<CardanoWallet />

// Or use the hook for custom UIs
const { connected, wallet, connect, disconnect } = useWallet();
```

No wallet-specific code. No detection logic. Just connection that works.

### Transactions Without Complexity

Cardano transactions involve UTxOs, inputs, outputs, change addresses, fees, and serialization. With Mesh, you describe what you want to happen:

```typescript
const utxos = await wallet.getUtxos();
const changeAddress = await wallet.getChangeAddress();
const txBuilder = new MeshTxBuilder();

// Build a transaction to send ADA and tokens
const unsignedTx = await txBuilder
  .txOut("addr...", [{ unit: "lovelace", quantity: "10000000" }])
  .txOut("addr...", [{ unit: "policyId" + "assetName", quantity: "1" }])
  .changeAddress(changeAddress)
  .selectUtxosFrom(utxos)
  .complete();
```

The SDK calculates fees, selects UTxOs, manages change, and serializes correctly. You focus on what, not how.

### Reading Blockchain Data

Query addresses, assets, and transactions with simple methods:

```typescript
import { BlockfrostProvider } from "@meshsdk/core";

const provider = new BlockfrostProvider("your-api-key");

// Get UTxOs at an address
const utxos = await provider.fetchAddressUTxOs("addr...");

// Get asset information
const asset = await provider.fetchAssetMetadata("policyId", "assetName");
```

No raw API calls, no response parsing, just the data you need.

## Learning Path

### Week 1: Wallet Integration

Start with wallet connectivity:

```tsx
import { MeshProvider, CardanoWallet, useWallet } from "@meshsdk/react";

function App() {
  return (
    <MeshProvider>
      <Header />
    </MeshProvider>
  );
}

function Header() {
  const { connected, wallet } = useWallet();

  return (
    <header>
      <CardanoWallet />
      {connected && <WalletInfo wallet={wallet} />}
    </header>
  );
}
```

Learn: React context, wallet state, connected/disconnected handling.

### Week 2: Simple Transactions

Add transaction capability:

```typescript
async function sendPayment(wallet, recipient, amount) {
  const utxos = await wallet.getUtxos();
  const changeAddress = await wallet.getChangeAddress();

  const txBuilder = new MeshTxBuilder();
  const unsigned = await txBuilder
    .txOut(recipient, [{ unit: "lovelace", quantity: amount }])
    .changeAddress(changeAddress)
    .selectUtxosFrom(utxos)
    .complete();

  const signed = await wallet.signTx(unsigned);
  const hash = await wallet.submitTx(signed);

  return hash;
}
```

Learn: Transaction building, signing, submission, hash tracking.

### Week 3: Token Operations

Work with Cardano native tokens:

```typescript
const txBuilder = new MeshTxBuilder();

// Send existing tokens
txBuilder.txOut(recipient, [{ unit: "policyId" + "tokenNameHex", quantity: "10" }]);

// Mint new tokens (requires policy script)
txBuilder
  .mint("1000", policyId, tokenNameHex)
  .mintingScript(forgingScript);
```

Learn: Asset structure, minting, multi-asset transactions.

### Week 4: Smart Contracts

Interact with Plutus scripts:

```typescript
import { mConStr0 } from "@meshsdk/core";

const txBuilder = new MeshTxBuilder();

// Lock funds at script address with inline datum
txBuilder
  .txOut(scriptAddress, [{ unit: "lovelace", quantity: "50000000" }])
  .txOutInlineDatumValue(mConStr0([]));

// Unlock from script with redeemer
txBuilder
  .spendingPlutusScriptV2()
  .txIn(utxo.input.txHash, utxo.input.outputIndex)
  .txInInlineDatumPresent()
  .txInRedeemerValue(mConStr0([]))
  .txInScript(scriptCbor);
```

Learn: Datums, redeemers, script addresses, contract interaction.

## Common First Projects

### NFT Gallery

Display user's NFT collection:

```tsx
import { useAssets } from "@meshsdk/react";

function NFTGallery() {
  const assets = useAssets();

  const nfts = assets?.filter(a =>
    a.quantity === "1" && a.unit !== "lovelace"
  );

  return (
    <div className="gallery">
      {nfts?.map(nft => (
        <NFTCard key={nft.unit} asset={nft} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Payment Button

Accept ADA payments:

```tsx
function PaymentButton({ amount, recipient }) {
  const { wallet, connected } = useWallet();

  const pay = async () => {
    const utxos = await wallet.getUtxos();
    const changeAddress = await wallet.getChangeAddress();

    const txBuilder = new MeshTxBuilder();
    const unsigned = await txBuilder
      .txOut(recipient, [{ unit: "lovelace", quantity: amount }])
      .changeAddress(changeAddress)
      .selectUtxosFrom(utxos)
      .complete();

    const signed = await wallet.signTx(unsigned);
    await wallet.submitTx(signed);
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={pay} disabled={!connected}>
      Pay {Number(amount) / 1_000_000} ADA
    </button>
  );
}
```

### Token Airdrop Tool

Send tokens to multiple addresses:

```typescript
async function airdrop(wallet, recipients, tokenUnit, amountEach) {
  const utxos = await wallet.getUtxos();
  const changeAddress = await wallet.getChangeAddress();

  const txBuilder = new MeshTxBuilder();

  recipients.forEach(address => {
    txBuilder.txOut(address, [{ unit: tokenUnit, quantity: amountEach }]);
  });

  const unsigned = await txBuilder
    .changeAddress(changeAddress)
    .selectUtxosFrom(utxos)
    .complete();

  const signed = await wallet.signTx(unsigned);
  return wallet.submitTx(signed);
}
```

## Why Beginners Choose Mesh

### Skip the Blockchain Deep Dive

Other approaches require understanding Cardano's ledger rules before writing code. Mesh lets you build first and learn the underlying concepts as curiosity or need arises.

### JavaScript You Know

No new programming language. No unfamiliar syntax. Just npm install and code in the JavaScript or TypeScript you already write daily.

### Working Examples

Every Mesh feature has working examples in the documentation. Copy, paste, modify, and see results immediately rather than piecing together theory.

### Error Messages That Help

When something goes wrong, Mesh provides clear messages pointing to the issue. Not cryptographic dump, but "Insufficient funds: you need X lovelace but only have Y."

### Community Support

Active Discord community where beginners get answers. No question too basic. The Mesh team and experienced users help newcomers succeed.

## Testing Your dApp

### Preprod Testnet

Test with fake ADA before mainnet:

1. Get test ADA from the [Cardano Testnet Faucet](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-testnet/tools/faucet/)
2. Switch your wallet to preprod network
3. Test all functionality risk-free
4. Move to mainnet when confident

### Local Development

Use Mesh with local development servers:

```tsx
// Development with Next.js, Vite, or Create React App
// Just npm run dev and start building
```

No local blockchain node required. Mesh connects to public infrastructure.
