Mesh provides a complete toolkit for NFT development on Cardano, enabling developers to create, mint, and manage non-fungible tokens with ease. Whether you're building a simple minting application or a full-featured NFT marketplace, Mesh offers the APIs and utilities you need.

## Why Build NFTs with Mesh?

Cardano's native token model makes NFT development uniquely powerful compared to other blockchains. Unlike Ethereum where NFTs require smart contracts for basic minting, Cardano NFTs are first-class citizens on the network. Mesh leverages this architecture to provide streamlined APIs for NFT operations while supporting advanced Plutus-based functionality when needed.

**Key advantages:**

- **Native multi-asset support** - Mint NFTs without smart contracts using native scripts
- **Low fees** - Cardano's predictable fee model keeps minting costs minimal
- **CIP compliance** - Built-in support for CIP-25 and CIP-68 metadata standards
- **Plutus integration** - Advanced NFT logic with smart contract validation
- **Batch operations** - Mint entire collections in optimized transactions

## Core NFT Capabilities

### Minting Native NFTs

The most common NFT use case involves minting tokens with native scripts. Mesh's transaction builder makes this straightforward, handling policy ID generation, metadata attachment, and transaction construction automatically.

Native NFTs work well for:
- Single NFT mints for art or collectibles
- Collection launches with predefined supply
- Event tickets or proof-of-attendance tokens
- Membership and access tokens

### Plutus NFT Contracts

For advanced use cases requiring on-chain validation logic, Mesh supports Plutus NFT contracts. These enable programmable rules that govern minting conditions, transfers, and burns.

Plutus NFTs enable:
- Royalty enforcement on secondary sales
- Time-locked minting windows
- Whitelist-based access control
- Dynamic metadata updates (CIP-68)
- Burn-to-redeem mechanics

### Metadata Standards

Mesh provides utilities for constructing compliant NFT metadata following Cardano Improvement Proposals:

**CIP-25** - The original NFT metadata standard, storing information in transaction metadata. Suitable for static NFTs where metadata never changes.

**CIP-68** - The datum-based metadata standard enabling on-chain storage and updates. Ideal for dynamic NFTs, gaming assets, and evolving collectibles.

## Building NFT Marketplaces

Beyond minting, Mesh supports building complete NFT marketplace infrastructure:

- **Listing and delisting** - Lock NFTs in escrow contracts for sale
- **Purchase flows** - Handle payments and NFT transfers atomically
- **Auction systems** - Implement bidding with time-based resolution
- **Royalty distribution** - Automated creator royalties on each sale
- **Collection management** - Organize and query NFTs by policy ID

## NFT Development Patterns

When building NFT applications, consider these common patterns:

**Collection Policy** - Use a single policy ID for all NFTs in a collection, with unique asset names distinguishing individual tokens. This enables easy collection queries and verification.

**Metadata IPFS Pinning** - Store NFT images and extended metadata on IPFS, referencing the content hash in on-chain metadata. This balances decentralization with cost efficiency.

**Lazy Minting** - Defer actual minting until purchase, reducing upfront costs for large collections while maintaining provable scarcity.

**Reveal Mechanics** - Mint with placeholder metadata initially, then update to final artwork after a reveal event using CIP-68 datum updates.

## Integration with Providers

Mesh works with multiple blockchain data providers to query NFT information:

- **Blockfrost** - NFT metadata and ownership queries
- **Koios** - Policy and asset information endpoints
- **Maestro** - Rich NFT data including marketplace listings
- **Custom providers** - Build your own indexer integration

Each provider offers NFT-specific endpoints for fetching metadata, ownership history, and marketplace activity. See the <Link href="/providers">Providers documentation</Link> for configuration details.
