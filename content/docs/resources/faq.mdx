Find answers to common questions about Mesh, the open-source TypeScript SDK for Cardano.

## Getting Started

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="What is MeshJS?">
Mesh is an open-source TypeScript SDK that makes it easy to build Cardano blockchain applications. It provides a comprehensive suite of tools, React components, wallet integrations, and transaction builders to help developers Ship Cardano dApps faster.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why should I use Mesh for Cardano development?">
Mesh offers several advantages:
- **Lightweight**: Less than 60kB bundle size for fast-loading applications
- **Production-Ready**: Battle-tested with 1M+ downloads
- **Developer-Friendly**: Simple, intuitive APIs with excellent TypeScript support
- **Comprehensive**: Everything you need - wallet integration, transaction building, smart contracts
- **AI-Powered**: Built-in AI features to help you develop faster
- **Always Updated**: Kept current with the latest Cardano network changes
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is Mesh free to use?">
Yes! Mesh is completely open-source and free to use for both personal and commercial projects. You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What are the system requirements?">
Mesh requires:
- Node.js 16 or higher
- npm or yarn package manager
- TypeScript 4.5+ (recommended)
- For React projects: React 18+
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Installation & Setup

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="How do I install Mesh?">
Install Mesh Core using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install @meshsdk/core
```

or

```bash
yarn add @meshsdk/core
```

If you're building a React app, you can also install the optional React bindings:

```bash
npm install @meshsdk/react
```

Then follow our [Getting Started Guide](/guides) for setup instructions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use Mesh with Next.js?">
Yes! Mesh works great with Next.js. Check out our [Next.js integration guide](/guides/nextjs) for detailed setup instructions including App Router and Pages Router configurations.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does Mesh support other frameworks?">
Yes! While we have official React support, Mesh Core can be used with:
- Next.js
- Vue.js
- Svelte (we have a [Svelte package](/svelte))
- Angular
- Vanilla JavaScript/TypeScript
- Node.js backend applications
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Wallets & Integration

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Which Cardano wallets does Mesh support?">
Mesh supports all CIP-30 compliant Cardano wallets including:
- Nami
- Eternl
- Flint
- Typhon
- Yoroi
- Lace
- And many more!

The wallet integration is universal, so any new CIP-30 wallet is automatically supported.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I build a wallet application with Mesh?">
Absolutely! Mesh provides the `MeshWallet` class that allows you to create wallet applications. You can:
- Generate wallets from mnemonic phrases
- Import wallets from private keys
- Work with cardano-cli wallets
- Build multi-signature applications
- Create browser extension wallets

Check out the [Wallet documentation](/apis/wallets) for details.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I connect a wallet in my dApp?">
Use the `CardanoWallet` React component for the easiest integration:

```tsx
import { CardanoWallet } from '@meshsdk/react';

export default function MyApp() {
  return (
    <CardanoWallet
      label="Connect Wallet"
      persistence={true}
      onConnected={() => console.log('Wallet connected!')}
    />
  );
}
```

See our [wallet hooks documentation](/react/wallet-hooks) for more advanced use cases.
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Smart Contracts & Transactions

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Does Mesh support smart contracts?">
Yes! Mesh provides comprehensive smart contract support for both Plutus and Aiken:
- Transaction building with smart contract execution
- Datum and redeemer handling
- Script validation
- Multi-asset operations
- Complex transaction scenarios

Check out our [Smart Contracts guides](/smart-contracts) and [Aiken tutorials](/aiken).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I build transactions with Mesh?">
Mesh provides an intuitive transaction builder API via `MeshTxBuilder`. Here's a simple example for sending ADA:

```typescript
import { MeshTxBuilder } from '@meshsdk/core';

const txBuilder = new MeshTxBuilder({
  fetcher: provider,
  verbose: true,
});

const unsignedTx = await txBuilder
  .txOut(
    'addr1...', // recipient address
    [{ unit: 'lovelace', quantity: '1000000' }] // 1 ADA in lovelace
  )
  .changeAddress(changeAddress)
  .selectUtxosFrom(utxos)
  .complete();

const signedTx = await wallet.signTx(unsignedTx);
const txHash = await wallet.submitTx(signedTx);
```

See the [`MeshTxBuilder` documentation](/apis/txbuilder) for advanced features.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I mint NFTs with Mesh?">
Yes! Mesh makes NFT minting straightforward. We have dedicated guides for:
- [Minting your first NFT](/guides/nft-collection)
- [Multi-signature minting](/guides/multisig-minting)
- Creating NFT collections
- Metadata standards (CIP-25, CIP-68)

Check out our [NFT guides](/guides) for step-by-step tutorials.
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Development & Debugging

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="How do I test my Cardano dApp?">
Mesh supports testing on:
- **Cardano Testnet**: Use the preprod or preview test networks
- **Local DevNet**: Run [Yaci DevNet](/yaci) for faster development
- **Mainnet**: Deploy when ready for production

Configure the network by setting the `networkId` in your provider.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Where can I find code examples?">
We provide extensive examples:
- Throughout our [documentation](/docs)
- In our [guides section](/guides)
