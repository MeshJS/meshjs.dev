  faqs={[
    {
      question: "How hard is it to learn Cardano dApp development?",
      answer: "Cardano has a steeper learning curve than Ethereum due to its UTXO model, native asset system, and functional programming foundations. However, a TypeScript blockchain SDK like Mesh significantly reduces the barrier with familiar JavaScript APIs that abstract complexity while giving access when needed."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to learn Haskell to build Cardano dApps?",
      answer: "No. While Plutus smart contracts use Haskell, you can build full dApps using JavaScript/TypeScript with Mesh SDK. For on-chain logic, Aiken offers more familiar syntax. Most Cardano dApp development happens off-chain where JavaScript Web3 works perfectly."
    },
    {
      question: "What makes Cardano different from Ethereum for developers?",
      answer: "Cardano's UTXO model versus Ethereum's account model is the main difference. Instead of updating balances, you spend and create discrete outputs. Transactions are deterministic. Native assets don't require smart contracts. These require new mental models but enable parallel transaction processing."
    },
    {
      question: "What should I learn first for Cardano development?",
      answer: "Start with wallet integration and simple transactions using Mesh SDK. This teaches the UTXO model practically. Then explore native assets, metadata, and finally Cardano smart contracts. The Mesh Cardano SDK API guides this progression naturally."
    },
    {
      question: "Why does Cardano use unfamiliar terminology?",
      answer: "Cardano draws from academic research and functional programming. 'Lovelace' for smallest ADA unit, 'datum' for data, 'redeemer' for input. The Mesh TypeScript blockchain SDK uses clearer naming while maintaining compatibility."

Cardano dApp development has a steeper learning curve than Ethereum due to the UTXO model, native assets, and academic terminology. The Mesh Cardano SDK flattens this curve with intuitive TypeScript APIs that let you build functional dApps immediately while gradually introducing concepts. Ship your first transaction in minutes.

**Key Takeaway:** You don't need to understand everything about Cardano to start building. A JavaScript Web3 SDK like Mesh lets you learn progressively—simple transactions first, Cardano smart contracts later.

## Why Is Cardano Development Different?

Cardano development differs from Ethereum because of the UTXO model, native multi-asset support, and functional programming foundations. These architectural decisions prioritize formal verification and security but require JavaScript Web3 developers to learn new mental models. The Mesh Cardano SDK bridges this gap with familiar patterns.

### What Is the UTXO Mental Model Shift?

Most developers learn account-based blockchains first. Ethereum feels intuitive—accounts have balances. Cardano's UTXO model differs fundamentally:

| Ethereum (Accounts) | Cardano (UTXO) |
|---------------------|----------------|
| Single balance number | Set of discrete outputs |
| Transactions modify balance | Transactions consume and create outputs |
| Partial spending possible | Must consume entire UTXO, create change |
| Sequential processing | Parallel transaction processing |

Once understood, the UTXO model offers advantages. Initial confusion is normal.

### Do I Need to Learn Haskell?

Cardano's research-first approach means:

- Cardano smart contracts (Plutus) are built on Haskell
- Documentation assumes functional programming familiarity
- Terminology prioritizes precision over accessibility

**The good news:** Most Cardano dApp development happens off-chain with JavaScript Web3 tools. For on-chain logic, Aiken offers familiar syntax without learning Haskell.

### How Do Native Assets Differ from Ethereum Tokens?

On Cardano, tokens and NFTs don't require smart contracts:

- Defined by minting policies, not contract addresses
- Identified by policy IDs + asset names, not contract calls
- Live in UTXOs alongside ADA (creating "minimum ADA" requirement)

### Why Is Documentation Fragmented?

Cardano development spans multiple languages and tools:

- Cardano Foundation for concepts
- IOG documentation for Plutus
- Community tool documentation
- Multiple competing approaches

The Mesh Cardano SDK documentation consolidates JavaScript Web3 development guidance in one place.

## How Does Mesh SDK Make Cardano Development Easier?

The Mesh TypeScript blockchain SDK provides progressive complexity—simple APIs for common tasks, full control when needed. You learn Cardano concepts through practical use.

### How Do Mesh APIs Compare to Other SDKs?

Mesh uses patterns familiar to JavaScript Web3 developers:

```typescript
import { MeshWallet, BlockfrostProvider } from "@meshsdk/core";

// Similar to ethers.js pattern
const provider = new BlockfrostProvider("<your-api-key>");

const wallet = new MeshWallet({
  networkId: 0, // testnet
  fetcher: provider,
  submitter: provider,
  key: {
    type: "mnemonic",
    words: ["your", "mnemonic", "phrase", "..."],
  },
});

const address = wallet.getChangeAddress();
```

### What React Blockchain Components Does Mesh Provide?

Mesh provides pre-built React blockchain components that handle wallet connection, transaction signing, and state management. The `CardanoWallet` component supports all CIP-30 wallets with zero configuration—no protocol knowledge required.

```tsx
import { CardanoWallet, useWallet } from "@meshsdk/react";

function App() {
  const { connected, wallet } = useWallet();

  return (
    <div>
      <CardanoWallet />
      {connected && <p>Connected! Address: {wallet.getChangeAddress()}</p>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### How Does Transaction Building Work?

MeshTxBuilder uses a fluent interface describing intent, not UTXO mechanics:

```typescript
import { MeshTxBuilder } from "@meshsdk/core";

const txBuilder = new MeshTxBuilder({
  fetcher: provider,
  submitter: provider,
});

const unsignedTx = await txBuilder
  .txOut(recipientAddress, [{ unit: "lovelace", quantity: "5000000" }])
  .changeAddress(myAddress)
  .selectUtxosFrom(myUtxos)
  .complete();
```

You say "send 5 ADA to this address"—the Cardano SDK handles UTXO selection, fee calculation, and change automatically.

## How Do I Get Started?

**1. Install Mesh SDK**

```bash
npm install @meshsdk/core @meshsdk/react
```

TypeScript-first with full type definitions for excellent IDE support.

**2. Connect a wallet**

```typescript
import { BrowserWallet } from "@meshsdk/core";

const wallet = await BrowserWallet.enable("eternl");
// Or let users choose: await BrowserWallet.getAvailableWallets();
```

**3. Build and submit a transaction**

```typescript
import { MeshTxBuilder, BlockfrostProvider } from "@meshsdk/core";

const provider = new BlockfrostProvider("<your-blockfrost-key>");
const txBuilder = new MeshTxBuilder({ fetcher: provider, submitter: provider });

const unsignedTx = await txBuilder
  .txOut("addr_test1...", [{ unit: "lovelace", quantity: "2000000" }])
  .changeAddress(await wallet.getChangeAddress())
  .selectUtxosFrom(await wallet.getUtxos())
  .complete();

const signedTx = await wallet.signTx(unsignedTx);
const txHash = await wallet.submitTx(signedTx);
```

You've built a Cardano transaction without managing UTXOs, calculating fees, or understanding serialization formats.

## What Is the Recommended Learning Path?

The recommended path starts with wallet integration and simple transfers, then progresses to native assets and finally Cardano smart contracts. The Mesh Cardano SDK design supports this progression with APIs that grow in complexity as your understanding deepens.

| Week | Focus | What You Learn |
|------|-------|----------------|
| 1 | Wallets + ADA transfers | Addresses, transaction lifecycle, UTXOs |
| 2 | Native assets | Token mechanics, minimum UTXO requirements |
| 3 | Metadata | Transaction metadata, advanced patterns |
| 4+ | Cardano smart contracts | Datums, redeemers, script execution |

### Week 2: Native Assets Example

```typescript
const tx = await txBuilder
  .txOut(recipient, [
    { unit: "lovelace", quantity: "2000000" },
    { unit: policyId + assetName, quantity: "10" }
  ])
  .changeAddress(changeAddress)
  .selectUtxosFrom(utxos)
  .complete();
```

### Week 4+: Cardano Smart Contracts Example

```typescript
const tx = await txBuilder
  .spendingPlutusScript("V2")
  .txIn(scriptUtxo.input.txHash, scriptUtxo.input.outputIndex)
  .txInScript(scriptCbor)
  .txInDatumValue(datum)
  .txInRedeemerValue(redeemer)
  .complete();
```

By this point, "datum" and "redeemer" make sense from practical context.

## What Does Cardano Terminology Mean?

| Term | Meaning | Mesh Usage |
|------|---------|------------|
| Lovelace | Smallest ADA unit (1M = 1 ADA) | `{ unit: "lovelace", quantity: "1000000" }` |
| UTXO | Unspent output—a "coin" you can spend | `wallet.getUtxos()` |
| Datum | Data attached to script output | `txInDatumValue()` |
| Redeemer | Input to unlock script output | `txInRedeemerValue()` |
| Policy ID | Token collection identifier | Part of asset unit string |
